\section{I. Primary Question}
How accurate are computational thermochemical tools in predicting experimentally measured metrics across AP-based formulations containing various catalytic metal additives?

\section{II. Secondary Question 1}
Do predictive errors correlate with specific catalyst types, concentrations, or other formulation discrepancies?

\section{III. Secondary Question 2}
Is atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations (LAMMPS w/ ReaxFF) detailed enough to reveal mechanisms that can explain the variance between equilibrium-based thermochemical predictions and empirical observation within catalyzed systems?
